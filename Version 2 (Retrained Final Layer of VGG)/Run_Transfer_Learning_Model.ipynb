    "This script will run the model trained by Transfer_Learning_Training.ipynb\n",
    "There are two functions. \n",
    "* LoadModel() : Loads model\n",
    "* predict() : Takes model and directory path for images to be predicted as arguments and classify the image. Last three lines of the method can be uncommented to move irrelevant or relevant images to different folders\n",

    "### Usage\n",
    "Can be used as a filter damaged buildings and undamaged buildings and move them in different directories."
